## Come over here to see the animal sanctuary!

Just kidding, if you're looking for animals, they're not here. *chirp chirp* **KEEP QUIET!**

Nevermind that, this is a  **CODING TEAM** which makes programs for anything. This is mainly dedicated to PocketMine-MP. You can request things to be added, ~~ask for things to be fixed~~ (just kidding don't ask for things to be fixed, let us know in the plugin REPOSITORY which we own, not the OLD one).


## To make an request:

Make sure you're following the plugin request guide. If we broke a plugin state the issue it in it's repository, this is for plugin requests for us to make/revive.

## Terms:

We would ask that you please read the licenses and not go against them. This is community work and you may do whatever you wish with the files provided on this page.

### The UniLicense is used across most projects. Please read the license of each program would wish to use.
